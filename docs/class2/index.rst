BIG-IP Next Access
==================

Intro
-----

Welcome to the BIG-IP Next Access lab!

In this new lab we will explore a couple of the use cases within BIG-IP Next Access.

Federation: We will go over how to configure and setup federation in BIG-IP Next Access which acts as a service provider (SP) integrating with identity provider (IdP) such as Okta to manage authentication and authorization for accessing protected applications.

The types of federation examples we will cover in this lab are:

- Signed SAML Federation with Okta
- Azure Authentication with Kerberos Single Sign On (SSO)

Certificate Authentication: We will also explore how to leverage Next Access to do Certificate Based authentication to protected application.
